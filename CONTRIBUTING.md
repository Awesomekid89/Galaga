Go ahead and contribute if you want to! I would love to collaborate on this project, even if it strays from the original!

Just start your pull request and/or [email me](mailto:halseide.izak@gmail.com) ([ihalseide](https://github.com/ihalseide))!

This isn't a very large project, so the process of contributing should be simple.
